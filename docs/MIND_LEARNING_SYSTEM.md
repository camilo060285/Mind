# Mind's Learning System

## Overview

NewscastStudio is **Mind's training ground**. Every broadcast creates data that helps Mind learn and improve.

## How It Works

### 1. Broadcast Recording 🎬
When you create a broadcast:
```bash
newscast create "Apple stock news"
```

Mind **automatically records**:
- The market topic you provided
- Analysis generated by MarketAnalystAgent
- Script written by NewsScriptAgent  
- Directions created by AnchorDirectorAgent
- Timestamps and metadata

**Where it's stored:** `~/.mind/broadcast_memory/performance_log.jsonl`

### 2. Feedback Collection 📊
After each broadcast performs (views, shares, engagement):
```bash
newscast feedback broadcast_20260214_120000_apple_stock \
  --engagement 75 \
  --quality 8 \
  --comments "Great scripting, could improve anchor energy"
```

This tells Mind:
- ✅ What worked (high engagement)
- ❌ What needs improvement (lower quality areas)
- 💭 Why (your comments)

### 3. Learning Analysis 🧠
Check what Mind has learned:
```bash
newscast learn
```

Output:
```
=== Mind's Learning Report ===

Evolution Phase: Pattern Recognition
Broadcasts Analyzed: 12
Ready for Optimization: Yes
Ready for New Agents: No

📋 Next Priority Actions:
  • Fine-tune agent prompts based on current feedback
  • Identify top performing topic patterns
  • Optimize prompt formulations

🤖 Potential New Agent Types:
  • SentimentAnalystAgent: Gauge market sentiment beyond facts
  • PredictionAgent: Predict which stories will trend
```

## Evolution Phases

### Phase 1: Data Collection (0-5 broadcasts)
- Mind gathers baseline performance data
- No patterns yet, just raw information
- **Goal:** Collect initial dataset

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition (5-20 broadcasts)  
- Mind identifies what works
- Detects high-performing topics
- Observes successful script structures
- **Goal:** Optimize existing agent prompts

### Phase 3: Agent Emergence (20-50 broadcasts)
- Mind has enough data to improve
- New agent types become viable
- Ready for advanced optimization
- **Goal:** Deploy new specialized agents

### Phase 4: Advanced Learning (50+ broadcasts)
- Mind is highly optimized
- Multiple agent types working together
- Can extrapolate to new products
- **Goal:** Cross-product learning and autonomy

## What Mind Learns

### Agent Performance Patterns 📈
- **MarketAnalystAgent**: Which topics generate best engagement
- **NewsScriptAgent**: Optimal script length, pacing, structure
- **AnchorDirectorAgent**: Direction styles that drive performance

### Topic Patterns 🎯
- Which market stories resonate most
- Seasonal/temporal patterns
- Topic combinations that work well

### Content Patterns ✍️
- Successful narrative structures
- Emotional engagement triggers
- Audience retention points

## Emerging Capabilities

As Mind collects data, new agent types become possible:

### SentimentAnalystAgent (20+ broadcasts)
Understands market mood beyond facts
```python
# Analyzes: "This is a mild correction" vs "Market panic" 
# Output: Emotional context + recommended tone
```

### PredictionAgent (40+ broadcasts)
Predicts which stories will trend
```python
# Analyzes historical performance
# Recommends topics likely to perform well
```

### RetentionOptimizer (50+ broadcasts)
Keeps viewers engaged throughout
```python
# Analyzes: Where do people drop off?
# Optimizes: Pacing, hooks, callbacks
```

## Using the Learning Loop

### Step 1: Create Broadcas
```bash
newscast create "Market topic" --verbose
```

### Step 2: Let it air
Deploy to YouTube, Twitter, etc. (when APIs integrated)

### Step 3: Collect metrics
Get engagement data from platform APIs

### Step 4: Provide feedback
```bash
newscast feedback <broadcast_id> \
  --engagement <score> \
  --quality <rating> \
  --comments "<what worked/didn't>"
```

### Step 5: Check learning progress
```bash
newscast learn
```

### Step 6: Iterate
Mind uses these insights to improve next broadcast

## Data Flow

```
NewscastStudio
  ↓ creates broadcast
Mind's BroadcastMemory
  ↓ stores agent outputs
Performance Log (~/.mind/broadcast_memory/)
  ↓ user provides feedback
FeedbackCollector
  ↓ analyzes patterns
LearningEngine
  ↓ generates insights
Agent Improvements & New Capabilities
```

## Key Insights So Far

After your first broadcasts, Mind can tell you:

✅ **High-performing topics** - Focus on these  
❌ **Low-performing patterns** - Avoid these  
⚙️ **Optimal configurations** - Use these settings  
🚀 **Emerging opportunities** - Try these new agents  

## Next Steps

1. **Create 5+ broadcasts** - Establish initial patterns
2. **Collect feedback** - Tell Mind which ones performed well
3. **Review learning report** - See what Mind discovered
4. **Apply insights** - Use recommendations for next broadcasts
5. **Repeat** - Continue the learning loop

## FAQ

**Q: Does this slow down broadcast creation?**
A: No. Learning happens in the background. Optional for users.

**Q: Can Mind break something by learning?**
A: No. Learning improves agents, doesn't replace them. You always have the original.

**Q: How long to see improvements?**
A: After 10-15 broadcasts with feedback, patterns emerge. After 30+, significant improvements.

**Q: Can this apply to other products?**
A: Yes! The learning system is product-agnostic. Build Twitter-Studio, Podcast-Studio, etc. All feed to Mind's learning.
