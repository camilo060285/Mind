# Mind

Mind is a modular, privacy‑first agentic meta‑system designed to orchestrate distributed subsystems, load dynamic blueprints, and execute autonomous workflows across heterogeneous hardware. It emphasizes sovereignty, transparency, and local‑first intelligence.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Mind is not a single agent — it is a **meta‑architect**.

It creates, supervises, and evolves agentic subsystems aligned with user meaning and values.  
It blends distributed cognition, local‑first autonomy, and transparent orchestration into a coherent platform for personal intelligence.

Mind is built to empower individuals, not institutions.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

Mind is composed of five core layers:

### **1. Identity Layer (`core/identity.py`)**
Defines Mind’s self‑description, metadata, capabilities, and versioning.  
This is the anchor for introspection, logging, and external integrations.

### **2. Blueprint Layer (`core/blueprint_loader.py`)**
Loads YAML‑based blueprints that describe:
- tasks  
- workflows  
- agent orchestration  
- execution rules  

Blueprints are the declarative heart of Mind.

### **3. Cognition Layer (`cognition/`)**
Implements Mind’s thinking protocol:
- reasoning  
- evaluation  
- decision‑making  
- context propagation  

This layer transforms blueprints into actionable steps.

### **4. Agent Layer (`agents/`)**
Agents are modular, pluggable units that perform actions:
- reading files  
- sending notifications  
- interacting with APIs  
- running local scripts  
- controlling hardware  

Agents are stateless, composable, and sandboxed.

### **5. Orchestration Layer (`core/orchestrator.py`)**
Coordinates:
- blueprint execution  
- agent invocation  
- cognitive loops  
- logging and error handling  

This is the execution engine of Mind.

## 🛠️ Development

Mind is designed to run on:
- Raspberry Pi  
- macOS  
- iOS Shortcuts  
- distributed local hardware  

All computation is local‑first.

## 🔒 Philosophy

Mind is built on three principles:

1. **Sovereignty** — Your data, your hardware, your rules.  
2. **Transparency** — No hidden processes, no black boxes.  
3. **Meaning** — Systems should align with human values, not replace them.
