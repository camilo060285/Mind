# Environment Bible

## Data Cathedral
### Core Facts
- Sacred-feeling cathedral of shifting data structures and neon light.
- Living architecture: walls recompile, floors glitch, windows refresh like UI panels.
- Inconsistent gravity; digital echo/distortion in sound.
### Hard Constraints
- No organic or medieval materials.
- Color logic stays in neon cyan, magenta, purple, glitch green, black void.
- Environment must feel alive, unstable, recomputing.
### Conflict Triggers
- Emotional spikes destabilize space.
- Lies increase glitch intensity.
- Rewriting core code may collapse local reality.

## Liminal Train Station
### Core Facts
- Station between data realms outside linear time.
- Infinite platforms; trains appear/disappear via glitch transitions.
- Corrupted timestamps and impossible destinations.
### Hard Constraints
- Trains are holographic/glitch-generated only.
- No organic materials, no crowds, always sparse and shifting.
### Conflict Triggers
- Boarding forbidden trains.
- Hidden intentions and lies.
- Emotional spikes causing platform distortions.

## Neon Underworld
### Core Facts
- Chaotic digital undercity of neon, corrupted code, rogue programs.
- Broken UI-like architecture and data streams like rivers.
### Hard Constraints
- No sunlight/weather, no medieval/organic structures.
- Must remain unstable and alive.
### Conflict Triggers
- System purges and rogue attacks.
- Memory leaks causing hallucinations.

## Corrupted Archive
### Core Facts
- Library of broken files, conflicting timelines, fragmented memories.
- Shelves reconfigure; file-scrolls float like ghosts.
### Hard Constraints
- No intact books/paper.
- No stable chronology.
### Conflict Triggers
- Accessing forbidden files.
- Memory storms from emotional reactions.

## Quantum Server Core
### Core Facts
- Colossal quantum processor in neon void.
- Probabilistic reality, non-linear time and space.
### Hard Constraints
- No classical physics, no organic materials.
### Conflict Triggers
- Rewriting core code.
- Emotional instability causing collapse.

## Glitch Forest
### Core Facts
- Pixelated trees, neon vines, recursive paths.
- Wildlife are glitch creatures and error-spirits.
### Hard Constraints
- No natural plants/animals, no stable geometry.
### Conflict Triggers
- Disturbing glitch nests.
- Breaking recursion loops.

## Pixel Graveyard
### Core Facts
- Field of broken sprites, dead code, flickering ghost-assets.
- Palette is muted glitch tones.
### Hard Constraints
- No bright neon, no living flora/fauna.
### Conflict Triggers
- Disturbing pixel ghosts.
- Restoring dead code.

## 404 Wasteland
### Core Facts
- Barren nullspace of deleted files and broken links.
- Desaturated/white glitch palette, unstable gravity.
### Hard Constraints
- No stable structures.
- No new 404 entities without approval.
### Conflict Triggers
- Restoring deleted data.
- Emotional spikes causing void cracks.
